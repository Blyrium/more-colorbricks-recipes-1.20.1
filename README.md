# More ColorBricks Recipes

**\/!\\ This mod is an add-on for Puggan's [*ColorBricks*](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colorbricks) \/!\\**

_More ColorBricks Recipes_ adds new recipes (duh) to Puggan's _ColorBricks_, and overwrites a few.

You can now use Concrete to create colourful brick blocks!

Finally, the default Stairs recipes have been overwritten (following Kxffie's [_More Blocks_](https://modrinth.com/datapack/more-blocks) example) to give you 8 Stairs instead of 4:

Tested with Fabric API 0.92.0+1.20.1 & ColorBricks 1.20.1-1.2.3

This mod is provided "as is". It should technically work on all 1.20.X versions of the game. Support for _ColorBricks_ versions above 1.2.4\* isn't guaranteed. I am not planning to update/backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft. You're free to do so yourself, however.

\* Not a typo.
